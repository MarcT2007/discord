Discord

1.Login Page

The login page allows returning users to sign in to their Discord account. It features a clean layout with a welcome message and a login form that includes fields for email/phone number and password. A password visibility toggle is provided. There’s also a link for users who have forgotten their password, and an alternative option to log in via QR code. A submit button is included, and users can navigate to the registration page if they don’t have an account. A JavaScript file (code1.js) is linked to enable functionality like password visibility.

2.Account Creation Page

The account creation page allows new users to sign up for Discord. It includes fields for email, display name, username, password, and date of birth. Users must agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and can opt-in to receive email updates. A submit button creates the account, and a link is provided for users to log in if they already have an account. JavaScript (code.js) handles form validation and dynamic dropdowns.

3.General Notes

Both pages are simple and responsive, focusing on essential features for a seamless user experience. They include external resources like SweetAlert2 for pop-up notifications, though it’s not actively used in the provided code.
